== Some example runs

In this section we will post a few example landscapes, along with how to get them running in MuddPILE.

=== Basic syntax of a *MuddPILEdriver* call

You should by now have *MuddPILEdriver* installed on your computer. If not, read this section: <<Installing MuddPILE>>.

. We will assume that you are working on our http://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_book/#_installing_lsdtopotools_using_virtualbox_and_vagrant[vagrant setup], and that you have cloned the https://github.com/LSDtopotools/MuddPILE[MuddPILE repository] into `/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects`.
+
. In any call to MuddPILE driver, you should have one terminal window open in the directory with the program, and one in the directory with the data. If you are using vagrant, you should use either `vagrant ssh` (in MacOS or Linux) or https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html[putty.exe] to create two terminal windows. 
+
. In the first terminal window, go to the directory with the code
+
[source, console]
----
$ cd /LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/MuddPILE/src/driver_functions
----
+
. You then call the program with two arguments: the data directory and the name of the driver function. The specific names of these for the examples will be shown in the example sections.
