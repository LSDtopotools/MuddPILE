=== The parameter file

The parameter file has keywords followed by a value. The format of this file is similar to the files used in the `LSDTT_analysis_from_paramfile` program, which you can read about in the section <<Running your first analysis>>.

NOTE: The parameter file has a specific format, but the filename can be anything you want. We tend to use the extensions `.param` and `.driver` for these files, but you could use the extension `.MyDogSpot` if that tickled your fancy.

The parameter file has keywords followed by the `:` character. After that there is a space and the value. 

.Chi mapping parameter file format
************************************************
. Lines beginning with `#` are comments.
. Keywords or phrases are followed by a colon (`:`).
. The order of the keywords do not matter.
. Keywords are not sensitive, but must match expected keywords.
. If a keyword is not found, a default value is assigned.

=== Parameter file options

Below are options for the parameter files. Note that all DEMs must be in ENVI `bil` format (**DO NOT** use ArcMap's bil format: these are two different things. See the section <<Preparing your data>> if you want more details). 
The reason we use `bil` format is because it retains georeferencing which is essential to our file output since many of the files output to `csv` format with latitude and longitude as coordinates. 


==== Basic file input and output

[cols="1,1,2", options="header"]
.File input and output options. **These do not have defaults and MUST be declared**.
|===
|Keyword
|Input type
|Description

|write path
|string
|The path to which data is written. **The code will NOT create a path: you need to make the write path before you start running the program.**

|read path
|string
|The path from which data is read.

|write fname
|string
|The prefix of rasters to be written *without extension*.
For example if this is `Test` and you have selected `bil` format then a fill operation will result in a file called `Test_Fill.bil`.

|read fname
|string
|The filename of the raster to be read without extension. For example if the raster is `MyRaster.bil`, read fname will be `MyRaster`.

==== DEM preprocessing

[cols="1,1,1,2", options="header"]
.DEM preprocessing. These just help you clean data and perform very basic operations.
|===
|Keyword
|Input type
|Default value
|Description


|minimum_elevation
|float
|0
|If you have the `remove_seas` keyword set to true, the program will change any elevation node below this value to NoData.

|maximum_elevation
|float
|30000
|If you have the `remove_seas` keyword set to true, the program will change any elevation node above this value to NoData.

|remove_seas
|bool
|false
|If true, this changes extreme value in the elevation to NoData.

|min_slope_for_fill
|float
|0.001
|The minimum slope between pixels for use in the fill function.
