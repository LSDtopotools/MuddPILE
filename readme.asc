= MuddPILE: The Parsimonious Integrated Landscape Evolution model

Welcome to MuddPILE. This is a simple landscape evolution model built into [LSDTopoTools]. The authors are Simon Mudd, James Jenkinson, Fiona Clubb and Declan Valters. It might seem narcissistic to call it MuddPILE given that it was a collaborative project but you must admit that calling a landscape evolution model "MuddPILE" is slightly amusing. If you do not think it amusing at all and belive that science should be very serious then you probably shouldn't every try to work with Simon Mudd, who is writing this readme in the third person. 

== What is MuddPILE?

MuddPILE is a very simple landscape evolution model that has fluvial erosion modelled with the stream power law (E = K A^m S^n) and hillslope evolution modelled with a nonlinear sediment flux law, e.g., http://seismo.berkeley.edu/~kirchner/reprints/1999_29_Roering_nonlinear.pdf[Roering et al., 1999, JGR]. It uses the https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sean_Willett/publication/236741975_A_very_efficient_On_implicit_and_parallel_method_to_solve_the_stream_power_equation_governing_fluvial_incision_and_landscape_evolution/links/0046351932d6e86514000000.pdf[FASTSCAPE] algorithm to compute fluvial erosion, and I cooked up a relatively fast implicit method to solve the hillslope equations since they are nasty and nonlinear.  You can force the model with spatially heterogeneous uplift and erodibility. It runs fairly quickly. So if your goal is just to generate some fairly simple landscapes with some fairly simple rules fairly quickly this is the model for you.   


== Compile instructions

MuddPILE is written in pass:[c++] and distributed as source code so you need to compile it. Instructions are below. 

=== Prerequisites

Firstly, this code was developed in Linux and it is a lot easer to install in Linux systems than other systems. Do you not run Linux? *Nae problem.* If you install [virtual box] and [vagrant] you can have a nice little Linux machine happily running away on whatever computer you are currently using. http://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_book/#_installing_lsdtopotools_using_virtualbox_and_vagrant[We have documentation explaining how to do this elsewhere].

. First you need all the GNU pass:[c++] tools and make. But basically every Linux operating system has this so don't worry about it. 
. Second, you need something called FFTW. If you alerady installed [LSDTopoTools] it is already on your computer. If not, install it like this (this is for Ubuntu, if you've not got `apt-get` then try `yum`):
+
[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt-get install -y libfftw3-dev
----
+
. Third, you need to decompress the http://www.boost.org/[boost] andhttp://www.simunova.com/mtl4[mtl4] libraries. We have packaged these up for you so our *MuddPILE* distribution is self-contained. To unzip, go into the `boost_mtl_minimal` directory and unzip using `tar`:
+
[source,console]
----
$ tar -xvzf boost_mtl_minimal.tar.gz
----
+
. Fourth, go into the /`src/driver_functions/` directory and make the program:
+
[source,console]
----
$ make -f MuddPILEdriver.make
----
+
. The result will be a program called `MuddPILEdriver.out`: this is the model! You can now run landscape evoltion runs. Check back here for documentation on actually running the model (we hope to have documentation ready by end September 2017).
